**Party Link (party-rentals)**  
Please refer to our jira for more detailed documentation.

**Overview**

- **Problem:** Party hosts often manage registrations through Instagram and other social media pages, making important information such as pricing, event details, location, availability, and registration difficult to find and inconsistent across hosts.

- **Solution:** Create a simple, centralized flow where attendees can easily discover party hosts, view event details and pricing, check availability, register, and submit payment for review.

- **Goal:** Make party registration faster, clearer, and more organized for attendees while giving hosts a centralized system to manage reservations, payments, and event information.

- **Scope:** The system consists of a mobile application for attendees and hosts and a web dashboard for verified hosts. The mobile app focuses on event discovery, booking, reservations, payments, digital tickets, and event management, while the web dashboard provides verified hosts with tools to monitor ticket sales, earnings, hosted events, and followers.  
  The system is focused specifically on event booking and management and does not include third-party services such as catering, transportation, equipment rentals, venue rentals, or security management. Payments are processed externally and are not held by the application.
